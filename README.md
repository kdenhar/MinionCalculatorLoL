# MinionCalculatorLoL

This is a basic calculator for better tracking minion farming in League of Legends. 
You will enter your time and minion count at the end of the game, and it will output for you the maximum CS 
for that game time and the Percentage of Minions you killed. This was built as a basic adaptation to 
Elyndar's CS guide on Reddit and is intended to help a user better track their farming improvements.
